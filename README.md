# pixel-art-maker

To create a canvas of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and click on the canvas's table cells to set their color.
See [Pixel Art Maker](https://colorscodex.github.io/pixel-art-maker/index.html), you can do many funny designs and uniques.  

Note: Due to implementation differences, it does not work effectively in Safari or Opera.

I used my front-end programming skills, including:

  - Defining variables with const and let.
  - Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object.
  - Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects.
  - Writing nested loops and using loop variables.
  
The users are able:

  1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
  2. Choose a color.
  3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
  
With this project I passed the first phase of Front-End Nanodegree Course of Udacity.
I included this repository in another repository: [Portfolio-Site](https://github.com/colorscodex/Portfolio-Site/blob/master/README.md).
